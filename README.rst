Welcome to the Cowrie GitHub repository
*****************************************

This is the official repository for the Cowrie SSH and Telnet
Honeypot effort.

What is Cowrie
*****************************************

Cowrie is a medium interaction SSH and Telnet honeypot designed to
log brute force attacks and the shell interaction performed by the
attacker.

`Cowrie <http://github.com/cowrie/cowrie/>`_ is developed by Michel Oosterhof.

Slack
*****************************************

You can join the Cowrie community at the following `Slack workspace <http://bit.ly/cowrieslack>`_.

Features
*****************************************

Some interesting features:

* Fake filesystem with the ability to add/remove files. A full fake filesystem resembling a Debian 5.0 installation is included
* Possibility of adding fake file contents so the attacker can `cat` files such as `/etc/passwd`. Only minimal file contents are included
* Session logs are stored in an `UML Compatible <http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/>`_  format for easy replay with original timings with the `bin/playlog` utility.
* Cowrie saves files downloaded with wget/curl or uploaded with SFTP and scp for later inspection log

Additional functionality over standard kippo:

* SFTP and SCP support for file upload
* Support for SSH exec commands
* Logging of direct-tcp connection attempts (ssh proxying)
* Forward SMTP connections to SMTP Honeypot (e.g. `mailoney <https://github.com/awhitehatter/mailoney>`_)
* Logging in JSON format for easy processing in log management solutions
* Many, many additional commands

Docker
*****************************************

Docker versions are available.

* To get started quickly and give Cowrie a try, run::

    docker run -p 2222:2222 cowrie/cowrie
    ssh -p 2222 root@localhost

* On Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/cowrie/cowrie

* Or get the Dockerfile directly at https://github.com/cowrie/docker-cowrie

Requirements
*****************************************

Software required:

* Python 2.7+, (Limited Python 3 support available for SSH only)
* python-virtualenv

For Python dependencies, see requirements.txt

Files of interest:
*****************************************

* `cowrie.cfg` - Cowrie's configuration file. Default values can be found in `etc/cowrie.cfg.dist`
* `share/cowrie/fs.pickle` - fake filesystem
* `etc/userdb.txt` - credentials allowed or disallowed to access the honeypot
* `honeyfs/` - file contents for the fake filesystem - feel free to copy a real system here or use `bin/fsctl`
* `honeyfs/etc/issue.net` - pre-login banner
* `honeyfs/etc/motd` - post-login banner
* `var/log/cowrie/cowrie.json` - transaction output in JSON format
* `var/log/cowrie/cowrie.log` - log/debug output
* `var/lib/cowrie/tty/` - session logs, replayable with the `bin/playlog` utility.
* `var/lib/cowrie/downloads/` - files transferred from the attacker to the honeypot are stored here
* `share/cowrie/txtcmds/` - file contents for simple fake commands
* `bin/createfs` - used to create the fake filesystem
* `bin/playlog` - utility to replay session logs

I have some questions!
